# Controllers and Services

- The main controllers are in [app/Http/Controllers/](mdc:app/Http/Controllers):
  - [SeoAnalyzerController.php](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/SeoAnalyzerController.php): Handles SEO analysis requests and returns results.
  - [SemController.php](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/SemController.php): Manages SEM (Search Engine Marketing) keyword and domain position checks.
  - [KeywordDensityController.php](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/KeywordDensityController.php): Analyzes keyword density for a given page.
  - [DomainAgeController.php](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/DomainAgeController.php): Checks the age of a domain.
  - [RobotsGeneratorController.php](mdc:app/Http/Controllers/RobotsGeneratorController.php): Generates and manages robots.txt files.

- Core business logic is implemented in service classes:
  - [SeoAnalyzerService.php](mdc:app/Services/SeoAnalyzerService.php): Orchestrates the SEO analysis process, calling specialized analyzers.
  - [DomainAgeService.php](mdc:app/Services/DomainAgeService.php): Handles domain age lookups.
  - [HttpClientKeywordService.php](mdc:app/Services/HttpClientKeywordService.php): Supports keyword-related HTTP requests.
  - Specialized analyzers in [app/Services/SeoAnalyzer/](mdc:app/Services/SeoAnalyzer) handle meta, heading, image, performance, URL, technical, and link analysis.

Controllers receive HTTP requests, validate input, and delegate analysis to the appropriate service classes, returning results to the user via views or JSON.
