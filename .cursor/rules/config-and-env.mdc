# Configuration and Environment

- Application configuration is managed in the [config/](mdc:config) directory:
  - [app.php](mdc:config/app.php): Main application settings.
  - [database.php](mdc:config/database.php): Database connection settings.
  - Other files configure cache, mail, queue, services, etc.
- Environment variables are set in a `.env` file, which is created from `.env.example` during setup (see [README.md](mdc:README.md)).
- The application key is generated with `php artisan key:generate`.
- Database migrations are run with `php artisan migrate`.

Configuration files and environment variables allow the application to be customized for different deployments and local development.
